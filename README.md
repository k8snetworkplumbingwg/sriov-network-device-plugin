## SR-IOV Network Device Plugin

The SR-IOV Network Device Plugin is Kubernetes device plugin for discovering and advertising networking resources in the
form of:
- SR-IOV virtual functions (VFs)
- PCI physical functions (PFs)
- Auxiliary network devices, in particular Subfunctions (SFs)

which are available on a Kubernetes host

## Features

- Handles SR-IOV capable/not-capable devices (NICs and Accelerators alike)
- Handles PCI backed Auxiliary network devices (**at the moment SFs only**)
- Supports devices with both Kernel and userspace (UIO and VFIO) drivers
- Allows resource grouping using "selector(s)"
- User configurable resourceName
- Detects Kubelet restarts and auto-re-register
- Detects Link status (for Linux network devices) and updates associated VFs health accordingly
- Extensible to support new device types with minimal effort if not already supported
- Works within virtual deployments of Kubernetes that do not have virtualized-iommu support (VFIO No-IOMMU support)

To deploy workloads with SR-IOV VF, Auxiliary network devices or PCI PF, this plugin needs to work together with the following two CNI components:

- Any CNI meta plugin supporting Device Plugin based network provisioning (Multus CNI, or DANM)

  - Retrieves allocated network device information of a Pod

- A CNI capable of consuming the network device allocated to the Pod
  - SR-IOV CNI (for SR-IOV VFs)
    - During Pod creation, plumbs allocated SR-IOV VF to a Pods network namespace using VF information given by the meta plugin
    - On Pod deletion, reset and release the VF from the Pod
  - Host device CNI (for PCI PFs)
    - During Pod creation, plumbs the allocated network device to the Pods network namespace using device information given by the meta plugin
    - On Pod deletion, reset and release the allocated network device from the Pod

Please follow the [Quick Start](#quick-start) for multi network interface support in Kubernetes.

## Quick Start

### Creating network functions

Before starting the SR-IOV Network Device Plugin you will need to create desired network functions on your system. Docs below will guide you through that process.

- [Creating SR-IOV Virtual Functions](docs/vf-setup.md)
- [Creating Subfunctions](docs/subfunctions/README.md)

### Install SR-IOV CNI

See the [SR-IOV CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-cni) repository for build and installation instructions. Supported from SR-IOV CNI release 2.0+.

### Get SR-IOV Network Device Plugin container image

#### GitHub

```sh
 docker pull ghcr.io/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-device-plugin:latest
```

#### Build image locally

```sh
 make image
```

> On a successful build, a docker image with tag `ghcr.io/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-device-plugin:latest` will be created. You will need to build this image on each node. Alternatively, you could use a local docker registry to host this image.

### Install SR-IOV Network Device Plugin

#### Deploy config map

Create a ConfigMap that defines SR-IOV resource pool configuration

> Make sure to update the 'config.json' entry in the configMap data to reflect your resource configuration for the device plugin. See [Configurations](#configurations) section for supported configuration parameters.

```sh
 kubectl create -f deployments/configMap.yaml
```

#### Deploy daemonset

```sh
 kubectl create -f deployments/sriovdp-daemonset.yaml
```

### Install one compatible CNI meta plugin

A compatible CNI meta-plugin installation is required for SR-IOV CNI plugin to be able to get allocated VF's deviceID in order to configure it.

#### Option 1 - Multus

##### Install Multus

Please refer to Multus [Quickstart Installation Guide](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni#quickstart-installation-guide) to install Multus.

##### Network Object CRDs

Multus uses Custom Resource Definitions(CRDs) for defining additional network attachements. These network attachment CRDs follow the standards defined by K8s Network Plumbing Working Group (NPWG). Please refer to [Multus documentation](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni/blob/master/README.md) for more information.

1. Create the SR-IOV Network CRD

```sh
 kubectl create -f deployments/sriov-crd.yaml
```

#### Option 2 - DANM

This section explains an example deployment of SR-IOV Network Device Plugin in Kubernetes if you choose DANM as your meta plugin.

##### Install DANM

Refer to [DANM deployment documentation](https://github.com/nokia/danm/blob/master/deployment-guide.md) for detailed instructions.

##### Create SR-IOV type networks

DANM supports the Device Plugin based SR-IOV provisioning with the dynamic level.
Refer to the [DAMN User Guide documentation](https://github.com/nokia/danm/blob/master/user-guide.md) for detailed instructions.
For example manifest objects refer to [SR-IOV demo](https://github.com/nokia/danm/tree/master/example/device_plugin_demo)

> See following sections on how to configure and run SR-IOV Network Device Plugin.

`"resourceList"` should contain a list of config objects. Each config object may consist of following fields:

|       Field       | Required |                                                              Description                                                               |                     Type/Defaults                     |                         Example/Accepted values                        |
|-------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "resourceName"    | Y        | Endpoint resource name. Should not contain special characters including hyphens and must be unique in the scope of the resource prefix | string                                                | "sriov_net_A"                                                          |
| "resourcePrefix"  | N        | Endpoint resource prefix name override. Should not contain special characters                                                          | string Default : "intel.com"                          | "yourcompany.com"                                                      |
| "deviceType"      | N        | Device Type for a resource pool.                                                                                                       | string value of supported types. Default: "netDevice" | Currently supported values: "accelerator", "netDevice", "auxNetDevice" |
| "excludeTopology" | N        | Exclude advertising of device's NUMA topology                                                                                          | bool Default: "false"                                 | "excludeTopology": true                                                |
| "selectors"       | N        | Either a single device selector map or a list of maps. The list syntax is preferred. The "deviceType" value determines the device selector options.                                                  | json list of objects or json object. Default: null                   | Example: "selectors": [{"vendors": ["8086"],"devices": ["154c"]}]        |
| "additionalInfo" | N | A map of map to add additional information to the pod via environment variables to devices                                             | json object as string Default: null  | Example: "additionalInfo": {"*": {"token": "3e49019f-412f-4f02-824e-4cd195944205"}} |

Note: "resourceName" must be unique only in the scope of a given prefix, including the one specified globally in the CLI params, e.g. "example.com/10G", "acme.com/10G" and "acme.com/40G" are perfectly valid names.

#### Device selectors

The "selectors" field accepts both a single object and a list of selector objects. While both formats are supported, the list syntax is preferred. When using the list syntax, each selector object is evaluated in the order present in the list. For example, a single object would look like:
```json
"selectors": {"vendors": ["8086"],"devices": ["154c"]}
```
and the list syntax would look like:
```json
"selectors": [{"vendors": ["8086"],"devices": ["154c"]}, {"vendors": ["8086"], "needVhostNet": true}]
```

The list syntax example specifies two selector objects in the list. In this example, all devices specified by the first selector object have vendor ID 8086 and device ID 154c. The second selector object specifies all devices with vendor ID 8086. Since the selector objects are processed in the specified order, devices with vendor ID 8086 and device ID 154c would not have the `needVhostNet: true` applied to them. Contrast this with another similar looking example:
```json
"selectors": [{"vendors": ["8086"], "needVhostNet": true}, {"vendors": ["8086"],"devices": ["154c"]}]
```
In this latter example, the order of the selector objects has been switched. Since all devices that are specified by the second object are also specified by the first object, this makes the second selector object ineffective.

A given selector object comprises of "selectors".  The "deviceType" value determines which selectors are supported for that device. Each selector is evaluated in order as listed in selector tables below.

#### Accelerator devices selectors
These selectors are applicable when "deviceType" is "accelerator".

|     Field      | Required |                Description                |         Type/Defaults         |       Example/Accepted values       |

[//]: # (The tables above generated using: https://ozh.github.io/ascii-tables/)

#### AdditionalInfo field

This field defines a method to add information as part of the environment variable the sriov-network-device-plugin injects to the container.

Examples:
```
"additionalInfo": {
   "*": {
     "token": "3e49019f-412f-4f02-824e-4cd195944205"
   }
}     
```
The '*' is a special key telling the device plugin to inject this info to all the devices matching the selector.
you can also specify a specific pci address if you want to override or add more information to a specific device

```
"additionalInfo": {
   "*": {
     "token": "3e49019f-412f-4f02-824e-4cd195944205"
   },
    "0000:86:00.0": {
    "additional-token": "6e7dc135-7a1c-456f-a008-c2cfb37997be"
    }

}   

output for pod allocating a different deviceID:
{"0000:3b:02.6":{"extraInfo":{"token":"3e49019f-412f-4f02-824e-4cd195944205"}

output for pod allocating the specific deviceID:
{"0000:86:00.0":{"extraInfo":{"token":"3e49019f-412f-4f02-824e-4cd195944205","additional-token": "6e7dc135-7a1c-456f-a008-c2cfb37997be"}
```

When having the same key for both the "*" and spefic deviceID variable the specific one will be taken

```
"additionalInfo": {
   "*": {
     "token": "original"
   },
    "0000:86:00.0": {
    "token": "specific"
    }

}   

output for pod allocating a different deviceID:
{"0000:3b:02.6":{"extraInfo":{"token":"original"}

output for pod allocating the specific deviceID:
{"0000:86:00.0":{"extraInfo":{"token":"specific"}
```

  -vmodule value
        comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging
```

### Assumptions

This plugin does not bind or unbind any driver to any device whether it's PFs or VFs. It also doesn't create virtual functions either. Usually, the virtual functions are created at boot time when kernel module for the device is loaded. Same with SFs. Required device drivers could be loaded on system boot-up time by allow-listing/deny-listing the right modules. But plugin needs to be aware of the driver type of the resources (i.e. devices) that it is registering as K8s extended resource so that it's able to create appropriate Device Specs for the requested resource.

For example, if the driver type is uio (i.e. igb_uio.ko) then there are specific device files to add in Device Spec. For vfio-pci, device files are different. And if it is Linux kernel network driver then there is no device file to be added.

The idea here is, user creates a resource config for each resource pool as shown in [Config parameters](#config-parameters) by specifying the resource name and a "selector object" or list of "selector objects". Each "selector object" contains "selector(s)".

The device plugin will initially discover all PCI network resources in the host and populate an initial "device list". If device type is Auxiliary network device (auxNetDevice), then for each discovered PCI device of type Netdevice the plugin discovers auxiliary devices. Each "resource pool" then applies its selector object(s) in order to the list of discovered devices. The plugin will add devices that satisfy the selector object's constraints to the resource pool. Each "selector" specified in the selector object narrows down the list of devices for the resource pool. Currently, the selectors are applied in following order:

1. "vendors"      - The vendor hex code of device
2. "devices"      - The device hex code of device
3. "drivers"      - The driver name the device is registered with
4. "pciAddresses" - The pci address of the device in BDF notation (if device type is accelerator or netDevice)
5. "acpiIndexes"  - The acpi index of the device
6. "auxTypes"     - The type of auxiliary network device (if device type is auxNetDevice).
7. "pfNames"      - The Physical function name
8. "rootDevices"  - The Physical function PCI address
9. "linkTypes"    - The link type of the net device associated with the PCI device

If a single device matches multiple selector objects, it will only be allocated to the first one.

The "pfNames" and "rootDevices" selectors can be used to specify a list and/or range of VFs/SFs for a pool in the below format
````
"<PFName>#<SingleFunc>,<FirstFunc>-<LastFunc>,<SingleFunc>,<SingleFunc>,<FirstFunc>-<LastFunc>"
````

Or

````json
"<RootDevice>#<SingleFunc>,<FirstFunc>-<LastFunc>,<SingleFunc>,<SingleFunc>,<FirstFunc>-<LastFunc>"
````

Where:

    `<PFName>`     - is the PF interface name
    `<RootDevice>` - is the PF PCI address
    `<SingleFunc>` - is a single function index (0-based) that is included into the pool
    `<FirstFunc>`  - is the first function index (0-based) that is included into the range
    `<LastFunc>`   - is the last function index (0-based) that is included into the range

Example:

The selector for interface named `netpf0` and VF 0, 2 up to 7 (included 2 and 7) and 9 will look like:

````json
"pfNames": ["netpf0#0,2-7,9"]
````

The selector for PCI address `0000:86:00.0` and VF 0, 1, 3, 4 will look like:

````json
"rootDevices": ["0000:86:00.0#0-1,3,4"]
````

If only PF network interface or PF PCI address is specified in the selector, then assuming that all VFs or SFs of this interface are going to the pool.

### Workflow

- Load device's (Physical function if it is SR-IOV capable) kernel module and bind the driver to the PF
- Create required VFs or SFs
- Bind all VFs with right drivers
- Create a resource config map
- Run SR-IOV Network Device Plugin (as daemonset)

On successful run, the allocatable resource list for the node should be updated with resource discovered by the plugin as shown below. Note that the resource name is appended with the `-resource-prefix` i.e. `"intel.com/sriov_net_A"`.

```json
$ kubectl get node node1 -o json | jq '.status.allocatable'

{
  "cpu": "8",
  "ephemeral-storage": "169986638772",
  "hugepages-1Gi": "0",
  "hugepages-2Mi": "8Gi",
  "intel.com/sriov_net_A": "8",
  "intel.com/sriov_net_B": "8",
  "memory": "7880620Ki",
  "pods": "1k"
}

```

## Example deployments

### Deploy SR-IOV workloads when Multus is used

There are some example Pod specs and related network CRD yaml files in [deployments](./deployments) directory for a sample deployment with Multus.

Leave the SR-IOV Network Device Plugin running and open a new terminal session for following steps.

#### Deploy test Pod connecting to pre-created SR-IOV network

````sh
$ kubectl create -f pod-tc1.yaml
pod "testpod1" created

$ kubectl get pods
NAME                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
testpod1              1/1       Running   0          3s
````

#### Verify Pod network interfaces

````sh
$ kubectl exec -it testpod1 -- ip addr show

1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

````

#### Verify Pod routing table

````sh
$ kubectl exec -it testpod1 -- route -n

Kernel IP routing table

````

### Deploy SR-IOV workloads when DANM is used

#### Verify the existence of the example SR-IOV networks

````sh
[cloudadmin@controller-1 ~]$ kubectl get dnet -n example-sriov
NAME         AGE
management   6s
sriov-a      14m
sriov-b      13m
````

#### Connect your networks to existing SR-IOV Device Pools

The Spec.Options.device_pool mandatory parameter denotes the Device Pool used by the network.
Make sure this parameter is set to the name(s) of your existing SR-IOV Device Pool(s)!

````sh
[cloudadmin@controller-1 ~]$ kubectl describe node 172.31.3.154 | grep -A8 Allocatable

[cloudadmin@controller-1 ~]$ kubectl describe dnet sriov-a -n example-sriov | grep device_pool
    device_pool:       nokia.k8s.io/sriov_ens2f1
[cloudadmin@controller-1 ~]$ kubectl describe dnet sriov-b -n example-sriov | grep device_pool
    device_pool:       nokia.k8s.io/sriov_ens2f1

````

#### Deploy demo Pod connecting to pre-created SR-IOV networks

First, make sure that your Pod asks appropriate number of Devices from the right Device Pools:

````sh
[cloudadmin@controller-1 ~]$ grep -B1 sriov_ sriov_pod.yaml
      requests:
        nokia.k8s.io/sriov_ens2f1: '2'
      limits:
        nokia.k8s.io/sriov_ens2f1: '2'
````

Then instantiate the Pod:

````sh
[cloudadmin@controller-1 ~]$ kubectl create -f sriov_pod.yaml
pod/sriov-pod created
````

#### Verify status and the network connections of the demo Pod

````sh
[cloudadmin@controller-1 ~]$ kubectl get pod sriov-pod -n example-sriov
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
sriov-pod   1/1     Running   0          111s

### Pod device information

The allocated device information is exported in Container's environment variable. The variable name is `PCIDEVICE_` appended with full extended resource name (e.g. intel.com/sriov etc.) which is capitailzed and any special characters (".", "/") are replaced with underscore ("_"). In case of multiple devices from same extended resource pool, the device IDs are delimited with commas (",").

For example, if 2 devices are allocated from `intel.com/sriov` extended resource then the allocated device information will be found in following env variable:
`PCIDEVICE_INTEL_COM_SRIOV=0000:03:02.1,0000:03:04.3`

There is also another environment variable that expose in json format more information about the device that was allocated like mount and addition variables if requested.
The variable name is `PCIDEVICE_<RESOUCE_NAME>_INFO` appended with full extended resource name (e.g. intel.com/sriov etc.) which is capitailzed and any special characters (".", "/") are replaced with underscore ("_")

vfio device example:
```
PCIDEVICE_INTEL_COM_DPDK_NIC_1_INFO={"0000:3b:02.6":{"vfio":{"vfio-dev-mount":"/dev/vfio/169","vfio-mount":"/dev/vfio/vfio"},"vhost":{"net-mount":"/dev/vhost-net","tun-mount":"/dev/net/tun"}}}

# Adding additionalInfo field to the resource definition will add additional information for every device allocated. e.g:
PCIDEVICE_INTEL_COM_DPDK_NIC_1_INFO={"0000:3b:02.6":{"extraInfo":{"token":"3e49019f-412f-4f02-824e-4cd195944205"},"vfio":{"vfio-dev-mount":"/dev/vfio/169","vfio-mount":"/dev/vfio/vfio"},"vhost":{"net-mount":"/dev/vhost-net","tun-mount":"/dev/net/tun"}}}
```

## Virtual Deployments Support

### Configure Device Plugin extended selectors in virtual environments

SR-IOV Network Device Plugin supports running in a virtualized environment.  However, not all device selectors are
applicable as the VFs are passthrough to the VM without any association to their respective PF, hence any device
selector that relies on the association between a VF and its PF will not work and therefore the _pfNames_ and
_rootDevices_ extended selectors will not work in a virtual deployment.  The common selector _pciAddress_ can be
used to select the virtual device.

## CNI plugins in virtual environments

SR-IOV CNI plugin doesn't support running in a virtualized environment since it always requires accessing to PF device
which usually doesn't exist in VM. The recommended CNI plugin to use in a virtualized environment is the [host-device](https://www.cni.dev/plugins/current/main/host-device/) CNI plugin.

### Virtual environments with no iommu

SR-IOV Network Device Plugin supports allocating VFIO devices in a virtualized environment without a virtualized iommu.
For more information refer to [this](./docs/dpdk/README-virt.md).

## Multi Architecture Support
